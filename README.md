## Intro
This guide is intended to introduce many programming concepts, programming related practices and tools, and philosophies of programming technique, approach, and style in order to provide a clear, holistic path for deeply exploring the art of programming. It is not intended to provide mastery of each of the subjects, but rather to explain them just enough to allow the reader to guide his or her self with direction and confidence through the myriad sources of information available elsewhere. Think of this as a detailed outline of many of the weapons available in the programmer's arsenal, sprinkled with tidbits of experience and wisdom from a career software engineer.

Although I aim to keep the document largely conceptual and agnostic from any particular language, platform, or software package, some concrete examples may be used to reinforce concepts. It is not my intent to teach any specific language or tool, but there is no guarantee that I will not be biased in favor of my own preferred implements.

## Basic Programming

There are many applications of programming and various paradigms, styles, and languages that make use of different techniques and concepts to best suit their purposes, but several basic programming concepts are universal to many or nearly all languages used in modern practice. Although the exact syntax and behavior will vary, many common programming languages treat them conceptually quite similarly.

### Variables

Similar variables in mathematics, variables in programming are symbolic names used to reference pieces of data. In computing terms, this means variables are symbols that refer or point to segments of memory. In practice this means they are names we give to pieces of data and use to recall and act on that data later on.

More important than variables themselves are the data they point to. Variables can reference simple values like numbers or strings of text, as well as more complex structures like collections or objects with properties and actions. Variables have _type_ which indicates the kind of data they point to. Different languages have different _type systems_ and handle variable types differently, but generally type impacts what information the data can hold and what operations we can do on it.

#### Primitive Types
Primitive types are the most basic kinds of values we can handle distinctly in programs; they are provided by the language itself and are the basic building blocks that more complex types are made from. 

##### String

##### Char

##### Integer

##### Decimal/Float

##### Boolean

##### Operations
    add
    multiply
    divide
    concatenation
    comparison (==, >, <, !=, etc...)
    ...

#### Collections
##### Array/List
##### Dictionary/hash/associative array
  
#### Loops
##### While
##### For

#### Execution Flow
##### if, else, else if
##### switch/case
