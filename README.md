### Basic Programming

#### Variables

Variables, similarly to mathematics, are symbolic names used to reference pieces of data. Variables can reference simple values like numbers or strings of text, as well as more complex structures like collections or objects with properties and actions. 
##### primitive types
    string
    integer
    decimal/float
    char
    boolean
    ...

  operations
    add
    multiply
    divide
    concatenation
    comparison (==, >, <, !=, etc...)
    ...

  collections
    array/list
    dictionary/hash/associative array
  
  loops
    while
    for

  execution flow
    if
    switch/case

  functions
    function calls
    defining functions
    return types
    parameters
    local variables
    pass-by-balue
    pass-by-reference

  event-driven programming
    asynchronous operations
    callbacks


Object Oriented Programming

    packaging/namespacing
    abstraction/refactoring
    design patterns
      singleton
      factory
      command
